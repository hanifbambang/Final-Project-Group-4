# Final-Project-Group-4

Hospital App is an application where doctors can assign patient symptoms and their medicine, so that the patient can checkout for the hospital. In real life hospitals, since its a huge time waster for the system to integrate from the doctor, patient and admin. Therefore, this app focuses on optimizing hospital systems to work much more efficiently. The user will have to choose to log in either as a doctor, a patient, or an admin when opening the application.  Each option will not be able to overlap, so in order to choose a different role, the user must sign out first.

## Role Functionalities 
### Doctor
If the user chose to be the Doctor, then the user will be able to prescribe medicines and the system will check its availability/stock.  The user is able to give comments on the patient's health as well. 

### Patient
Whereas If the user chose to be the patient then the user has 3 more options to pick, either to checkout in the hospital for the medicine, send the medicine to his house  or checkout in the other pharmacy.  The user is able to choose either to pay with online payment or cash. The user is able to input how much cash it has, before starting the simulation to pay their medicines. When checkout in other pharmacy, system will print the struck recommendation for the patient to checkout their medicine. When user wants to send their medicine to their house, system will automatically calculate the delivery fee. 

### Admin
When logging in as the Admin, user will be able to input the medicine stocks, new medicines, and medicine prices. The user will also be able to create accounts for both the patient and the doctor.
